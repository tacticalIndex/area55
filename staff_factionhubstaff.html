      <label>Hi! Unfortunately, this staff team has not been set up on this website. This may be due to a number of reasons. Common examples typically include:</label>
      <label>- The department not having any in-game duties,</label>
      <label>- The department High Command stating that they won't be using the website,</label>
      <label>- Or you seeing this page could just be either the website broken or the website down for maintenance.</label>
      <label>If you seeing this web page is an error, try retrying a few times. If the problem persists, read below for guidance.</label>
